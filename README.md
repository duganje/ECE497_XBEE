ECE497_XBEE
===========

repository for Rose-Hulman ECE497 XBee project 

The code in this repository is intended to interface the XBee radio modules with the BeagleBone andcreating wireless implementations for the sensors we have interfaced with the Bone. The top directory contains code to send integers and shorts using the XBee as well as an initialization routine to set up the pin muxes for uart 2. The three folders, Force Resistor, Mgnetometer and Joystick contain code for using XBee with specific sensors.
